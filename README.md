## Hi 👋

I am a master's graduate in biology with a strong interest in working with data. Throughout my degree, I gained vast experience in statistical analysis, which inspired me to pivot my career toward data analytics. I possess a strong foundation in this area, having demonstrated proficiency in applying statistical tests and data visualisation in R. I am keen to utilise and further develop these skills to provide meaningful insights in a business environment.
